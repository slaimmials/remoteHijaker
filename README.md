# Remote Hijacker v 0.2 #
This is something like a simple spy, but more simple and compatible

Update 0.2:
* added support of buffer deserealization
* fixed buttons in list of remotes
* fixed remote that appearing on right click
* fixed some type of "empty" remotes (still not all types)
* fixed scroll size resetting on clear
